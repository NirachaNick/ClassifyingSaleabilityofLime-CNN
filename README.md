# ClassifyingSaleabilityofLime-CNN
Independent study: Classifying Saleability of Lime by Using CNN.// 
Nowadays, there are many applications that have been used in agriculture field to
facilitate human workers. Many researches have been focused on fruits grading based on
appearance features. Since lime is one of Thai economic corp that have high demand and
price all the year, a lot of limes are continually exported into the market. The appearance of
limes strongly impact the market value. So, the quality inspection is needed to avoid selling bad limes to customers which cause greatly affects to the customer base. Determining saleability of lime can be done by using humans or machines. Using human workers is timeconsuming, high cost and not accurate. Although there are fruit grading machines, they are expensive and difficult to reach for general farmers. This research has proposed method to classify saleability of lime into three categories which are buy, maybe, and not buy by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) because it is a deep neural network that has high performance in terms of images classification tasks. Hyperparameters tuning process has been used to search for the best model performance by using full factorial design. The hyperparameters that have been considered in the model are Epoch, Learning Rate, Decaying Rate and Momentum. Two experiments of hyperparameters tuning were constructed. The first experiment constructed by initial 25 full factorial by setting low and high value. Afterthat, the result from first experiment was analysed by using Minitab to remove unimportantfactors. The model performance in this research has been evaluated by f1-score which the first experiment gave the highest results as 76%, 79%, 80% in training model, 73%, 77%, 77% in validation and 74%, 77%, 77% of testing for buy, maybe and not buy respectively.
